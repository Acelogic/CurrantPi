Clone this repo somewhere your webserver can see it.\r\n2. Cross Fingers. \r\n3. Point your browser at your webserver.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n<p>&copy; 2016 <a href=\"http://colinwaddell.com/\">Colin Waddell</a> under the terms of the<a href=\"https://github.com/ColinWaddell/RPi-Board-Info/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\"> MIT License.</a>\r\n \r\nScreenshot\r\n----------\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ColinWaddell/RPi-Board-Info/screenshots/img/screenshot.png?loadnew=true\" align=\"left\" width=\"384\" />\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
