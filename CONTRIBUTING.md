Contributing
============
You can contribute to this project [pushing to your fork and submitting a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/).

At this point you're waiting on me. I'd like to at least comment on pull requests as soon as possible, but sometimes real-life gets in the way. I may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

When contributing to CurrantPi keep in mind that the target audience wants to unpack the repo and (with any luck) tinker with the code. The shouldn't have to deal with fancy design patterns and abstractions. I'd like to keep code as simple (but not stupid), clean and readable as possible.

**Code should be simple enough that any eager beginner can follow it.**
